# standup-tracker

This is a todo application that will track when you complete your todos.

It also has a section below your incomplete todos that are only completed todos.
This section has a filter just above it that defaults to today with the option of being able to select yesterday or 2 days ago.
This helps me know what to report on for standup meetings each morning.

Right now the theme for the application is using the Cyberpunk theme from Daisy UI.
